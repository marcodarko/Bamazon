**Bamazon App** 
An app that interacts with a database using 8Node.js8 and 8MySQL8.  The app works similarly to Amazon, where a user can deplete the store inventory or add new items to it.   

As a **CUSTOMER** you can:

1. **VIEW INVENTORY** and it will tell you if
there's **NO INVENTORY** to complete your order:
